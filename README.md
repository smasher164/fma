# fma

This repository contains three software implementations for Fused-Multiply Add (FMA) for 64-bit floating-point values written in Go. The goal is to have a precision guaranteed to match that of hardware implementations of the IEEE-754 2008 standard's FMA operation.
- The first is a translation of [MUSL](http://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/math/fma.c)'s implementation that uses mostly integer arithmetic.
- The second is a translation of [FreeBSD](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/msun/src/s_fma.c?view=markup)'s implementation that uses mostly floating-point arithmetic.
- The third is a translation of [SoftFP](https://bellard.org/softfp/)'s implementation, originally written by Fabrice Bellard.

The tests are generated by [Berkeley TestFloat 3e](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/TestFloat.html), which verifies conformity to the IEEE Standard.

Work still needs to be done to include:
- [x] Benchmarks to compare and improve performance of the two implementations.
- [x] Assembly implementations that use the above software implementation as a fallback.
